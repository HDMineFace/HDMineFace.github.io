<div class="post"><h1>Pre-Split? Community Edition?</h1><div class="post_content">Hi there, and welcome to Team Fortress 2 Classic: Community Edition!  Now, you may have a few questions like "What's a pre-split?!" and "Community- What now?!"  
This blog post will attempt to answer some of those confusing, burning questions!  This post will be brief and more info can be found in the FAQ page on our <a href="https://discord.gg/7JStYpQbwM">Discord!</a> We hope you'll check it out and have fun.<br />
<img src="content/blog/g6lkjdfg594.png" alt="content/blog/g6lkjdfg594.png" /><br />
<br />
<b>What is this?</b><br>
<p>Maintained by the community, TF2Classic Community Edition is a passion project to keep the removed Deathmatch mode alive, picking up development right where it left off!  We use a previously un-released indev version of Team Fortress 2 Classic, 
the last version with the Deathmatch mode, and build off it into a brand new game.  This project is mainly focused on finishing and maintaining existing features, whilst backporting newer ones.  Originally started as a small patch for the leaked Pre-Split 
build, with constant community support we've been able to take our small little fix pack project and turn it into something much much bigger!</p><br>
<b>Are you allowed to release this?</b><br>
<p>As far as we're aware, yes!  When deathmatch was split, Compucolor pictures were given ownership of all Deathmatch related assets.  Previously, they're community manager expressed that their team does not mind this build 
of the game circulating, as long as it isn't labeled as their game Team Deathmatch Classic.  That being said, <u>this build is NOT TDC!!!</u>  You can find information on Compucolor Picture's spin on dm <a href="https://compucolorpictures.com/">here.</a>  
As for the TF2c side of things, they've never been too picky about people playing previous builds of the game, especially since 2.0.0 has released.  We are not trying to be a replacement, nearly an alternative with some cut content!</p><br>
<b>Final Points</b><br>
<p>Told ya we'd be brief.  As always, more information can always be found on our <a href="https://discord.gg/7JStYpQbwM">Discord.</a>  More will eventually be posted to this site when the next big version releases 
which will fully solidify the game's rebrand.  You can also jump straight into the game through our <a href="download.html">downloads page,</a> which includes an easy install tutorial.  Happy Fragging!</p>

Meet BSPVis. This tool is a tool created by our very own PistonMiner. It reads heatmap data from our official servers and shows it off in a three-dimensional window alongside all of the important entities contained within the level you're viewing. It will let us take the data from any game mode and edit the map entities in order to combat problematic areas within our levels. We will be collecting and processing a lot of data in the next beta release, which is approaching shortly.<br />
 <br />
The data from these heatmaps is read from here (links to: http://services.0x13.io/tf2c/logs/), which dumps the data from everyone's kills inside of our maps into spreadsheets showing the killer's location, the time of the kill, and the unfortunate victim's location.<br />
<img src="content/blog/96vkmjo75h4m.png" alt="content/blog/96vkmjo75h4m.png" /><br />
The heatmap is then generated.<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/amce3XK.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/amce3XK.png" /><br />
<br />
This works with any map on any game mode.<br />
This is the 2D generated heatmap for DM_Wiseau.<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fHrlA5P.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/fHrlA5P.png" /><br />
<br />
This is the 3D view from BSPVis. The mercenary spawns, weapon spawns, item entities and heatmap data are all visible. You can toggle between showing killer location and victim location. <br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wF2vBhx.jpg" alt="http://i.imgur.com/wF2vBhx.jpg" /><br />
<br />
This allows us to immediately visualize areas that are prone to frequent camping. In the above screenshot, we noticed that players seem to grab the supershotgun, run to the ladder, and kill enemies from behind <b>a lot.</b> With the approach of the second wave beta, we are putting ourselves in the best position we can to capture all the relevant data we need to have a full release.<br />
